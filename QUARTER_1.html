                ICT-TLE this quarter is just okay for me, we learned new stuff, codes, tags and etc. We were active more often than last year, we did lots of activities and hands-on on the ICT lab. Though due to the shortened time, I had some quite trouble on our class hands-ons. It is also troubling for me on how frustrating it is to debug or find errors in my code, especially while being pressure to take a spot on the top 10 or at least finish it. Due to the shortage of time too, sometimes the lessons go on too quickly that I can't catch up. We learned lots of new codes and tags in ICT, by lots, I mean <b> many</b>, there are so many newly introduced attributes, tags, elements that i just get more confused to which is where and forget more often due to my limited memory capacity. But overall, ICT class this quarter has been great, we had lots of fun, lots of competition and lots of frustrating moments too.
