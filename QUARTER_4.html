                                    <h2>SSLG Elections</h2>
                                      At the last day of February, the school initiated a 'Miting de Avance' to meet the tobe elected SSLG officers at the same day.
                                      From the start, I didn't think this was a good idea to hold such a long, long event. As a student, I know pretty well how short
                                      the attention span of students. Well in the elections, I was more of leaning to the Liyab side. Honestly speaking, what student
                                       wants are new things that they haven't had yet and the printing press by Kuya Lorenzo was top tier. Although I was dissatisfied 
                                       with the final result or line-up most especially that the printing press is not gonna happen. I don't know how kuya didn't got voted
                                       when i was so sure he was gonna get voted but oh well, i never really liked politics annd such.

                                    <h2>MAPEH Month</h2>
                                    I didn't really 'feel' MAPEH month this year. First the Art Fair, was less exciting or just feels like something want
                                    missing to it, though same as last years i didnt buy anything at all. Second, BotB or Battle of the Bands, I didnt join 
                                    the event since it was at a saturday, but also because I was busy. But I heard everyone had a good time and there were a lot that 
                                    'happened' that caused frustrations and worries to some teachers. And I can name a certain classmate. Third, Street Dance, I wasn't part of the people
                                     danced but im quite prooud of them, they danced so nicely but too bad I wasn't able to watch the whole thing since it was a report card day, I was also cleaners.
                                     Fortunately I was able to watch the dance made by my classmates and students from fairness, they did so well hahaha. Lastly, I joined the digital logo making 
                                     contest, although i didn't win.

                                    <h2>English ONE-ACT PLAY</h2>
                                      For the last weeks the whole classroom has been busy with the one-act play in english which almost all subjects 
                                      collaborated in. Our play is an adaptation of the movie "Mamma Mia". In the Play, I was elected to be the props
                                      head manager. If im being honest I didn't do well as a leader but oh well, i wasn't particularly doing fine doing props.
                                      Props was easy going until that horrid arch came. We were the first section to act our play in the auditorium at March 17, 2025.
                                       So I had to rush the unfinished Arch but in the end made it. While watching our play, I was astonished by the acting skill of my fellow 
                                       classmates, who worked hard to be and act the main character. Although the only down-side in our play was how mostly you can barely hear 
                                       the dialouge. You can't even sometimes understand what they are sayig in the video at this point. But im proud of my section and wish to get 1st 
                                       place of course.

            <p>
                Hahaha, so this school year is about to end huh. Hi po Miss thank you po sa lahat niyo pong ginawa para sa amin, Lab namin pu kayu ᰔᩚᰔᩚᰔᩚ. <br>
                This school year felt slow and the same time it just speed on by, i can't quite describe it. I still can't believe it is the Fourth Quarter. Again its the 4th
                Quarter right now, meaning my grade 9 life is coming to an end, my life as a grade 10 student beginning and my future as a college student nearing.
                Though it's too early yet think about the future (im just running away from that thought) its still the fourth quarter meaning "Hell quarter". Since it is the last
                quarter, it felt rushed, I don't like the fact that almost all subjects planned a summative/long test on the same week. I also didn't like it when the deadlines for big
                activities, performance task or main quests so near or like short-lived. I can barely sleep just to do all these assignments and tasks, and this E-Portfolio is 
                one of them now. Excuse me for complaining but not only I lack sleep, my whole body aches, my hand hurts form writing too many stuffs at the same day to the point I formed a callous
                , my back hurts from slouching, my eyes and troat dries up from overuse and syempre, hindi mawawala sa listahan ang sakit ng ulo. What pains me the most is that I continue
                to work nonstop to prepare for college, just when do I plan onn sleeping and caring for myslef, my room is even too messy and haven't cleant properly for who knows how many months. 
                Welp, good luck to me, good luck to you too Miss Uminga or whoever is reading this. Stay well and happy, I continue to wish you a gerat year.
